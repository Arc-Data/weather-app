# weather-app

This was actually a fun project. I was surprised that I can make it this far without asking for 
help in some parts where I initially thought coding would stress me out. Minor nitpick is 
that I am unable to access data regarding maximum and minimum temperatures of certain locations
because of the limits of openweather api free subscription limits. Did a fun little experiment 
on trying to design for screen sizes right at the end. I might not be able to enjoy it as much
but knowing I can do it if I actually try is very nice.
